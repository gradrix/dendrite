# Summary - Fixes Applied (October 25, 2025)

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. September 2025 Query - FIXED ✓
**Problem**: Query for "September 2025" activities was generating invalid Python code with syntax errors.

**Solution**: Added `ast.parse()` syntax check to `_validate_python_code()`:
```python
import ast
try:
    ast.parse(python_code)
except SyntaxError as e:
    return None  # Force regeneration
```

**Test Result**: ✅ Successfully counted **62 running activities** in September 2025

---

### 2. State Management CLI Tool - ADDED ✓
Created `scripts/state.sh` with commands:
- `list` - Show all keys
- `get <key>` - Retrieve value
- `delete <key>` - Remove key
- `search <pattern>` - Find keys
- `count` - Total keys

**Usage**: `./scripts/state.sh help`

## 📋 State Management - When to Use It

### ✅ Good Use Cases
1. **Cross-session memory**: Remember kudos givers across days
2. **User preferences**: Distance units, display format
3. **Long-term patterns**: Track training trends over months

### ❌ Bad Use Cases
1. **API response caching** (use data_compaction instead)
2. **Single-query data** (automatic caching handles this)

### Example
```yaml
# Good: Remember people
goal: "Get activities and save kudos givers to memory"
# Later: "Who from my kudos list was active recently?"

# Bad: Cache responses
goal: "Save activities to state"  # ❌ Use automatic caching
```

## 🎯 Test Results

```bash
Goal: How many running activities in September 2025?
Result: 62 activities
Duration: 21s
Status: ✅ Success
```
