# Test Dendrite Spawning
# This goal should trigger automatic list iteration

goal: "Get my recent Strava activities from the last 48 hours and for each activity that has kudos, get the names of all people who gave kudos."

schedule: manual

# Expected behavior:
# 1. Call getMyActivities to get my activities
# 2. Detect list result with activities
# 3. Spawn dendrites for each activity
# 4. Each dendrite calls getActivityKudos(activity_id)
# 5. Aggregate all kudos back into final result
