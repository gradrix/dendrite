# Ultra-Minimal Strava Monitor
# Radical simplification: 2 lines instead of 130!

goal: "Check for new activities in the last 24 hours, make non-Walk activities public (Rides must be over 10km), enable 3D satellite maps for public activities, and track kudos from all activities"

schedule: hourly

# That's it! The micro-prompting agent will:
# 1. Break this goal into micro-tasks
# 2. Discover tools as needed (not all at once)
# 3. Execute with tiny LLM prompts (100-200 tokens each)
# 4. Gradually build up the solution
# 5. Self-correct on errors
#
# Total execution: ~10-15 micro-prompts instead of 2-3 huge prompts
# Perfect for 3B models like qwen3:3b or llama3.2:3b!
