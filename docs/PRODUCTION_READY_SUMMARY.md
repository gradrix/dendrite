## Complete Flow Visualization

### Scenario 1: First Time Goal (System 2 - Full Reasoning)

```
User: "Get my Strava activities from last week"
    ↓
🔍 Check Neural Pathway Cache
   → Cache miss (never seen this goal before)
    ↓
📚 Check Learned Patterns
   → No similar patterns found
    ↓
🧠 FULL REASONING (System 2)
   → Decompose: ["Select Strava tool", "Execute get_activities", "Filter by date"]
   → Select tool: strava_get_my_activities (semantic search)
   → Generate code: tool.execute(after="2025-10-24")
    ↓
⚙️  Execute Tool
   → ❌ TimeoutError: Connection timeout
    ↓
🔄 ERROR RECOVERY
   → Classify: "transient"
   → Strategy: Retry with backoff
   → Retry #1 (wait 1s) → ❌ Still timeout
   → Retry #2 (wait 2s) → ✅ Success!
    ↓
💾 Cache Result
   → Store pathway with tool dependencies
   → Tools: [strava_get_my_activities]
    ↓
📚 Store Pattern
   → Save: goal + subgoals + success
   → Type: data_retrieval
    ↓
✅ Return: "Here are your 5 activities from last week..."

Duration: 4.2s (full reasoning + retry)
```

### Scenario 2: Same Goal Again (System 1 - Cached)

```
User: "Get my Strava activities from last week"
    ↓
🔍 Check Neural Pathway Cache
   → ✅ CACHE HIT! (100% similarity)
   → Pathway ID: abc123
   → Tools required: [strava_get_my_activities]
    ↓
🔍 Validate Tool Dependencies
   → Checking: strava_get_my_activities... ✅ Available
    ↓
⚡ DIRECT EXECUTION (System 1)
   → Execute cached pathway directly
   → Skip: decomposition, tool selection, code generation
    ↓
✅ Return: "Here are your 5 activities from last week..."

Duration: 0.08s (50x faster!)
```

### Scenario 3: Tool Removed (Cache Invalidation)

```
Admin: Deletes tool "strava_get_my_activities"
    ↓
🔄 Tool Lifecycle Manager
   → Detects: Tool removed from filesystem
   → Action: Mark as deleted in database
    ↓
🗑️  Neural Pathway Cache
   → Invalidate: All pathways using strava_get_my_activities
   → Pathways invalidated: 3
    ↓
User: "Get my Strava activities from last week"
    ↓
🔍 Check Neural Pathway Cache
   → Cache hit found BUT...
   → Validate tools: strava_get_my_activities... ❌ NOT FOUND
   → Cache invalidated automatically
    ↓
🧠 FALLBACK TO SYSTEM 2
   → Full reasoning mode
   → Find alternative: strava_get_dashboard_feed
   → Execute with new tool
    ↓
💾 Cache New Pathway
   → Store with new tool dependency
    ↓
✅ Return: "Here are your activities (using alternative tool)..."

Duration: 3.8s (full reasoning, but no errors!)
```

## Answer to Your Question

**Q: "If tool gets missing, would neural pathways be invalidated?"**

**A: YES! Absolutely.** Here's exactly how it works:

### Automatic Invalidation Flow

1. **Tool Deletion Detected**
   ```python
   lifecycle_manager.delete_tool("old_tool")
   ```

2. **Pathways Automatically Invalidated**
   ```python
   pathway_cache.invalidate_pathways_for_tool("old_tool")
   # Marks all pathways using "old_tool" as invalid
   ```

3. **Next Execution**
   ```python
   cached = pathway_cache.find_cached_pathway("similar goal")
   # Returns: None (pathway was invalidated)
   # OR validates tools before returning
   ```

4. **Graceful Fallback**
   ```python
   # System 2 kicks in
   # Finds alternative tool
   # Creates new pathway
   # No errors, just slower
   ```

### Key Safety Features

✅ **Tool dependency tracking**: Every pathway stores which tools it uses  
✅ **Automatic invalidation**: When tool removed, dependent pathways invalidated  
✅ **Validation before use**: Even if cached, tools are checked before execution  
✅ **Graceful degradation**: Falls back to System 2, doesn't crash  
✅ **Re-learning**: System finds new solution and caches it  

### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE neural_pathways (
    pathway_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    goal_text TEXT,
    goal_embedding vector(384),
    execution_trace JSONB,
    tools_used TEXT[],  -- ← Tool dependencies tracked here!
    result_summary TEXT,
    success_count INTEGER,
    failure_count INTEGER,
    is_valid BOOLEAN,  -- ← Invalidated when tools removed!
    ...
);

-- When tool deleted:
UPDATE neural_pathways 
SET is_valid = FALSE 
WHERE 'deleted_tool' = ANY(tools_used);
```

- Cache existed but wasn't used

✅ **After Integration Tests**:
- All components properly connected
- Error recovery integrated into Orchestrator
- Cache validation working
- Full end-to-end flow tested

### Integration Test Results
