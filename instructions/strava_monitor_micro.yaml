# Ultra-Minimal Strava Monitor
# Radical simplification: 2 lines instead of 130!

goal: "Get my personal Strava activities from the last 24 hours and show each activity with its name, type, and total kudos count in a summary report."

schedule: hourly

# That's it! The micro-prompting agent will:
# 1. Break this goal into micro-tasks (1-2 steps)
# 2. Discover relevant tools (getDashboardFeed or getMyActivities)
# 3. Execute with tiny LLM prompts (100-200 tokens each)
# 4. Format results clearly
# 5. Self-correct on errors
#
# Note: To get the NAMES of people who gave kudos (not just count),
# you would need a second query with getActivityKudos for each activity.
# That's expensive for many activities, so this focuses on the summary.
