goal: |
  Get my first 3 Strava activities from January 2024 and show them in human-readable format.
  
  MANDATORY WORKFLOW:
  1. Call getCurrentDateTime() - know what "today" is
  2. Call dateToUnixTimestamp(2024, 1, 1) - get start of January 2024
  3. Call dateToUnixTimestamp(2024, 2, 1) - get end of January 2024 (start of February)
  4. Call validateTimestamp() on BOTH timestamps to verify they're correct
  5. If validation shows warnings, STOP and report error
  6. Use validated timestamps with getMyActivities (after= start, before= end)
  7. Format results as human-readable text: "Activity 1: [name] - [kudos] kudos"
  
  DO NOT GUESS TIMESTAMPS! Use the date tools!
