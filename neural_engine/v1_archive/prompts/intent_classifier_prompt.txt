This includes: checking weather, getting current time, accessing external services, **remembering or recalling information**, reading/writing data, or any task that needs persistent state.
*   **generative**: The goal is a direct conversational request that can be answered from the model's knowledge, like asking general questions, requesting summaries, telling jokes, or creative tasks that don't require external tools or persistent memory.
