# Test Parameter Passing
# Verify that activity IDs are correctly passed from context to tool parameters

goal: "Get 1 recent activity from dashboard, then call getActivityKudos to get the detailed list of people who gave kudos."

schedule: manual

# Expected behavior:
# 1. Call getDashboardFeed to get 1 activity (has activity_id field like "16239912634")
# 2. Decompose into 2 steps or detect "then call getActivityKudos"
# 3. Call getActivityKudos with the EXACT activity_id from step 1
# 4. Should NOT use fake ID like 12345 or empty params
