# Cognitive Pathway Optimization - Vision for Phase 10+

## The Next Level: Learning to Think Better

**Current State (Phase 9d):** System improves individual tools  
**Next Level (Your Vision):** System improves how it THINKS about problems

---

## Three Levels of Cognitive Learning

### Level 1: Goal Decomposition Learning 🎯

**Problem:**
```
User: "Create a dashboard for sales data"

❌ First attempt (inefficient):
Subgoal 1: "Fetch data"
Subgoal 2: "Process somehow"  
Subgoal 3: "Display"
→ Vague, requires clarification, inefficient execution
```

**After Learning:**
```
User: "Create a dashboard for sales data"

✅ Learned pattern:
Subgoal 1: "Fetch sales data from database (last 30 days)"
Subgoal 2: "Calculate metrics: total, avg, trend"
Subgoal 3: "Create bar chart + line graph"
Subgoal 4: "Format as HTML dashboard"
→ Specific, clear, efficient execution
```

**How System Learns:**
1. Track goal → subgoal → execution patterns
2. Detect when subgoals are too vague (require clarification)
3. Learn from successful executions (what worked)
4. Store "goal decomposition patterns" in database
5. Next time: Apply learned pattern immediately

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE goal_decomposition_patterns (
    pattern_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    goal_type VARCHAR(255),  -- "create_dashboard", "analyze_data", etc.
    goal_keywords TEXT[],    -- ["dashboard", "sales", "data"]
    learned_subgoals JSONB,  -- Array of refined subgoals
    success_rate FLOAT,      -- How often this pattern works
    times_used INT,
    last_used TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

---

### Level 2: Goal Refinement & Auto-Correction 🔄

**Problem:**
```
User keeps saying: "Analyze the data"

System notices pattern:
- 80% of time, user then asks for visualization
- 60% of time, user wants comparison to last week
- 90% of time, user wants summary statistics
```

**Solution: Auto-Suggest Refinement**
```
User: "Analyze the data"

System: "I've noticed you often want:
  ✓ Summary statistics
  ✓ Visualization
  ✓ Week-over-week comparison
  
Should I include these automatically? [Y/n]"
```

**Or: Auto-Refine Silently**
```
User: "Analyze the data"

System internally expands to:
- Calculate summary statistics
- Create visualization  
- Compare to previous period
- Generate insights report

→ Delivers complete result in one go
→ User happy, no back-and-forth
```

**Implementation:**
- Track user goal → follow-up pattern
- Learn implicit requirements
- Build "user preference profiles"
- Auto-expand common goals

---

### Level 3: Neural Pathway Compression 🧠⚡

**The Key Insight:**
Just like biological brains, repeated patterns should become "instinctive" (fast, cached) while rare patterns need full reasoning (slow, thoughtful).

**First Time (Full LLM Reasoning):**
```
User: "Get my Strava activities"

System:
1. Intent classification neuron fires → "tool_use"
2. Tool selector searches all tools
3. LLM reasons about which tool to use
4. Code generator creates execution code
5. Sandbox executes
→ Takes 5 seconds, uses lots of tokens
```

**After 100 Times (Learned Pathway):**
```
User: "Get my Strava activities"

System:
1. Pattern recognizer: "Known pathway!"
2. Loads cached execution plan
3. Directly executes: strava_get_my_activities_tool()
4. No LLM needed!
→ Takes 0.5 seconds, minimal tokens
```

**On Failure (Revert to Reasoning):**
```
User: "Get my Strava activities"

Cached pathway executes → FAILS (API changed? New auth?)

System:
1. Detects failure
2. "Learned pathway broken, reverting to full reasoning"
3. Runs full LLM pipeline
4. Finds root cause
5. Learns NEW pathway
6. Caches updated pathway
→ Self-healing!
```

**Implementation:**
```python
class NeuralPathwayCache:
    """
    Cache learned execution pathways for common goals.
    Like muscle memory for the AI.
    """
    
    def check_cached_pathway(self, goal: str) -> Optional[ExecutionPlan]:
        """
        Check if we have a learned pathway for this goal.
        Uses embedding similarity to find matching patterns.
        """
        goal_embedding = self.embed(goal)
        matches = self.vector_db.search(goal_embedding, threshold=0.95)
        
        if matches:
            pathway = matches[0]
            # Check if pathway still valid (success rate > 90%)
            if pathway['success_rate'] > 0.9:
                return pathway['execution_plan']
        
        return None  # Need full reasoning
    
    def execute_cached_pathway(self, plan: ExecutionPlan) -> Result:
        """Execute pre-learned pathway directly."""
        result = self.execute_direct(plan)
        
        if result.success:
            self.update_pathway_stats(plan, success=True)
            return result
        else:
            # Pathway failed! Invalidate cache, force full reasoning
            self.invalidate_pathway(plan)
            return None  # Triggers full LLM reasoning
    
    def learn_new_pathway(self, goal: str, execution_trace: List):
        """
        After successful execution, cache the pathway.
        """
        pathway = {
            'goal_pattern': goal,
            'goal_embedding': self.embed(goal),
            'execution_plan': self.compress_trace(execution_trace),
            'success_rate': 1.0,
            'times_used': 1,
            'created_at': datetime.now()
        }
        self.vector_db.insert(pathway)
```

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE neural_pathways (
    pathway_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    goal_pattern TEXT,
    goal_embedding VECTOR(1536),  -- For similarity search
    execution_plan JSONB,  -- Compressed execution steps
    success_rate FLOAT,
    times_used INT,
    last_success TIMESTAMP,
    last_failure TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    
    -- Invalidate if too many recent failures
    CONSTRAINT valid_pathway CHECK (success_rate > 0.5)
);

-- Vector similarity index for fast lookup
CREATE INDEX idx_pathway_embedding ON neural_pathways 
USING ivfflat (goal_embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

- Cached pathway = Fast (0.5s), cheap
- Full reasoning = Slow (5s), expensive
- Cache on success, invalidate on failure
- System learns and adapts continuously
```

System: Executes cached pathway → FAILS
- Error: Invalid parameter 'type'
- Invalidate cached pathway
- Revert to full reasoning
- Discovers: API now uses 'activity_type' not 'type'
- Updates pathway
- Execution: Success!
Duration: 5.5 seconds (back to reasoning)
Tokens: 1600
New pathway learned!
```

### Iteration 101+: Recovered
```
User: "Show my recent Strava runs"

System: New cached pathway
- Execute: strava_get_my_activities_tool(activity_type="Run", limit=10)
- Execution: Success!
Duration: 0.6 seconds ⚡
Tokens: 50 💰
Self-healed and back to fast!

The autonomous loop (Phase 9d) would be enhanced:

```python
async def _detect_opportunities(self):
    # Existing: Detect tool improvement opportunities
    tool_opportunities = self._detect_tool_issues()
    
    # NEW: Detect cognitive inefficiencies
    cognitive_opportunities = []
    
    # 1. Find inefficient goal decompositions
    inefficient_goals = self._find_inefficient_decompositions()
    cognitive_opportunities.extend(inefficient_goals)
    
    # 2. Find repeated patterns not yet cached
    uncached_patterns = self._find_cacheable_patterns()
    cognitive_opportunities.extend(uncached_patterns)
    
    # 3. Find goals that could use Python instead of LLM
    python_opportunities = self._find_python_candidates()
    cognitive_opportunities.extend(python_opportunities)
    
    return tool_opportunities + cognitive_opportunities
```

**Year 3:**
- System has "intuition"
- Instant reactions for common patterns
- Deep reasoning only for novel problems
- Learns new patterns quickly

**Year 5:**
- System thinks like an expert
- Accumulated knowledge
- Fast, efficient, intelligent
- Continuously adapting

**This is how biological intelligence works!** 🧠

## Key Insight

You're describing **the transition from System 2 (slow, deliberate) to System 1 (fast, intuitive) thinking** - exactly like Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory!

- **System 2 (LLM):** Slow, analytical, flexible, expensive
- **System 1 (Cached):** Fast, automatic, efficient, cheap

AI should do the same:
- Use System 2 for novel problems
- Learn successful patterns
- Compress to System 1 for speed
- Fall back to System 2 when needed

**This is the path to true intelligence!** 🚀
