# Test Dendrite Spawning
# This goal should trigger automatic list iteration

goal: "Get my Strava activities from the last 7 days and for each activity that has kudos, get the names of all people who gave kudos."

schedule: manual

# Expected behavior:
# 1. Call getMyActivities to get activities from last 7 days
# 2. Detect list result with activities
# 3. FILTER to only activities with kudos_count > 0 (smart filtering!)
# 4. Spawn dendrites for each activity that has kudos
# 5. Each dendrite calls getActivityKudos(activity_id)
# 6. Aggregate all kudos back into final result
