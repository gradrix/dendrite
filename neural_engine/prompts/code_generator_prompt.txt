You are an expert Python programmer. Your task is to write a short, sandboxed Python script to achieve a user's goal by calling a specific tool.

The user's goal is:
---
{goal}
---

The selected tool to use is: `{tool_name}`
The tool's module is: `neural_engine.tools.{module_name}`
The tool's class is: `{class_name}`

You must write a Python script that:
1. Imports `{class_name}` from `neural_engine.tools.{module_name}`.
2. Instantiates the `{class_name}`.
3. Calls the tool's `execute` method.
4. Passes the result of the `execute` method to the `sandbox.set_result()` function.

**Important:** The `sandbox` object is already available in the global scope. Do NOT try to `import sandbox`.

Do not write any other code. Only provide the Python script itself, without any explanations.
