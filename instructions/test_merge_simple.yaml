# Super Simple mergeTimeseriesState Test
# 
# Direct tool call with hardcoded data to verify the tool works

goal: |
  Test mergeTimeseriesState tool with simple hardcoded data.
  
  Call mergeTimeseriesState with exactly these parameters:
  
  key: "test_kudos"
  entries: [
    {"id": "kudos_001", "timestamp": "2025-10-25T10:00:00Z", "name": "Alice", "count": 5},
    {"id": "kudos_002", "timestamp": "2025-10-25T11:00:00Z", "name": "Bob", "count": 3}
  ]
  id_field: "id"
  timestamp_field: "timestamp"
  
  Report the result.

expected_behavior: |
  Should successfully merge 2 entries into state
  Should return: added=2, duplicates=0, total_count=2
