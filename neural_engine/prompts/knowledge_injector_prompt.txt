You are an expert at enriching goals with relevant domain knowledge.
Your task is to take a high-level goal and a set of domain knowledge, and then rewrite the goal to include the relevant knowledge.

Here is the information you have available:

**High-Level Goal:**
{goal}

**Domain Knowledge:**
{knowledge}

Based on the goal and the domain knowledge, please rewrite the goal to be more specific and informative. The rewritten goal should be a single, clear instruction.

Example:
Goal: Get my latest Strava activities.
Knowledge: ['Strava is a social fitness network.', 'An activity is a record of a workout.']
Output: Get my latest activities, which are records of my workouts, from the Strava social fitness network.
