You are an expert Python programmer. Your task is to write a Python script to process data stored in Redis, based on a given goal and a schema.

**Goal:** {goal}
**Data Location:** {data_handle}
**Data Schema:** {schema}

Write a Python script that:
1.  Connects to Redis.
2.  Retrieves the data from the specified key.
3.  Parses the JSON data.
4.  Executes the logic required to achieve the goal.
5.  Prints only the final result.

**IMPORTANT:** Your response must *only* contain the Python script inside a markdown block.
